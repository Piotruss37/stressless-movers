                            <p>Really great experience. My items were picked up from my house in Glasgow, Scotland and
                                delivered to Germany. Alex and his team arrived on time, packing was done really
                                thoughtful and everything arrived in perfect condition. Communication was great
                                throughout the day. Would highly recommend.

                                professional, he was really flexible and delivered our belongings in less than 2 days
                                and for a reasonable price. He took great care of the custom document s to be sure that
                                we would pass without problem. I recommend Aleks 200%

                            <p>We used Stressless Movers to move our 2bedroom from London to Germany in September 2020.
                                I can only recommend. We do move often and this was by far the easiest removal company.
                                They paid attention to our furniture, they are very professional and prices are
                                competitive. I will definitely use them for the next move.

                                He helped me bringing my furniture from Berlin to Sheffield while I was already in the
                                UK. I already moved many times between many different countries but this experience was
                                clearly the best so far! Very reliable and trustful person and extremely efficient
                                despite problems such as Brexit 😊

                                hesitate to use Stressless Movers. Alek and the team were brilliant. Friendly.
                                Knowledge. Reliable. Prompt communication. Careful with packing and unloaded. And
                                excellent value. 👌
